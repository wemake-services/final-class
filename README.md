Final classes for `python3.6+`.


## Features

- No metaclass conflicts
- No runtime overhead
- No dependencies
- Type hints included, [PEP-561](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0561/) and [PEP-591](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0591/) compatible
- Designed to be as simple as possible


## Why?

In languages like `java` we have a nice way
to restrict subclassing any class by making it `final`:

```java
public final class SomeClass {
  // ...
}
```

In `python` we don't have such feature out of the box.
That's where `final_class` library comes in!

This package works perfectly with `@final` from `typing`.
So, with `final_class` you will have both type-checking and runtime checks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install final_class
```


## Usage

```python
from final_class import final


@final
class Example(object):  # You won't be able to subclass it!
    ...


class Error(Example):  # Raises `TypeError`
    ...
```
